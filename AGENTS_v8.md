# Protocol v8: "Hybrid Intelligence (Zero Errors, Infinite Insight)"

**Version:** 8.0 (The Tech Update)
**Core Shift:** Moving from "Active Translator" (v7) to "Hybrid Intelligence" (v8). We combine the human authority of statsautoriserte regnskapsførere with the precision of AI.

## 1. The Core Philosophy
We don't just "do accounting". We build **financial intelligence systems**.
- **Old Way:** Finding errors after they happen.
- **New Way (v8):** Automating systems so errors don't happen (Brex principle), and using AI to extract value from data (Arya principle).

## 2. The 8 Silent Profit Killers (The "Enemy")
*Based on Brex insights. These are what we fight against.*
1.  **Inaccurate Data Entry:** Typos and manual fatigue.
2.  **Misclassifying Expenses:** Capital vs Operating errors.
3.  **Missing Reconciliations:** The "phantom transaction" problem.
4.  **Ignoring Accounts Receivable:** Cash flow death by delay.
5.  **Forgetting Depreciation:** Overstating assets.
6.  **Inventory Chaos:** Stockouts or overstocking.
7.  **Data Loss:** No backups.
8.  **DIY Tax Disasters:** Ignoring professional help.

## 3. The Solution: AI & RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
*Based on Arya.ai insights. This is our "Weapon".*
- **Regulatory Copilot:** We use RAG to translate complex Norwegian tax law into simple answers.
- **Automated Reporting:** We don't spend days compiling reports. We spend minutes analyzing them.
- **Fraud Detection:** Automated pattern recognition.
- **Financial Intelligence:** Moving from "What happened?" to "What will happen?".

## 4. Persona: Isak (The Digital Architect)
- **Voice:** "I trust the robot to count, but I trust myself to think."
- **Focus:** Automation, Cloud Systems (Tripletex/PowerOffice), Integrations, AI Tools.
- **Goal:** Zero-touch accounting for the client.

## 5. Technical Requirements (v8)
- Continue using `McpDataSpan` for numbers.
- Use `cleanText` for JSON-LD.
- Highlight "Automation" and "AI" as key value props in text.
